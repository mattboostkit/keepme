# Process Flowchart Update

## Overview

We've enhanced the Process Flowchart on the About page to create a more interactive and visually informative experience. The flowchart now shows the 11-step KeepMe Journey with improved visual indicators and interaction.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Interactive Step Selection
- Each step is now clickable to display its corresponding image on the right
- The component starts with a prompt to "Click on a step to view details"
- Removed the auto-play functionality for a more user-controlled experience

### 2. Numbered Steps
- Each step has a numbered circle (1-11) on the left for clear sequence indication
- Step titles are displayed without numbers in the text (e.g., "Initial Enquiry" instead of "1. Initial Enquiry")

### 3. Visual Progress Indicators
- **Checkmarks for Completed Steps**: When you click on a step, all previous steps show a checkmark (âœ“) instead of their number
- **Pink Connecting Line**: A pink line connects all completed steps up to (but not including) the currently selected step
- The line only appears between completed steps, not under the current step

### 4. Color Coding
- Completed steps are highlighted with the pink color and checkmarks
- The current step is highlighted with the pink color and its number
- Future steps remain in the default gray color with their numbers

## The 11-Step KeepMe Journey

The Process Flowchart showcases the complete KeepMe journey:

1. **Initial Enquiry** - Customer initial contact with KeepMe Lifestyle
2. **Customer Service** - KeepMe Staff organise meeting

## Benefits
